5. source: i made it up matrix
we learned that it just works (maybe mom wants her phone back quicker)
recruitment: facetime
enviorment: their home and their devices
procedure:
mom1 female 34 child m 7 7m 45s account set up, vuk's aunt(1), home, facetime analyzing paper prototype 
mom2 female 42 child f 4 5m 35s account set up, vuk's aunt(2), home, facetime analyzing paper prototype
mom3 female 30 child m 8 7m 45s account set up, vuk's aunt(3), home, facetime analyzing paper prototype
mom4 female 27 child m 7 2m 55s account set up, rastko's neighbour, home, facetime analyzing paper prototype
mom5 female 50 child f 12 7m 30s account set up, djordje's mom 



7.a) there were a lot more customization options that whould complicate the application too much, from difficulty to where audio book stops/starts
b)The developlment of the high-fidelity prototype whould be challenging(it whould require voice acting and animation), but scaleing of the app from there on would be straightforward.

9. we found that ppl need to be told what to do(after we added the first 3 slides that explained the course of actions the time of setup lowered). We found that all prototypes need to be tested on the target audince so that the necessary impovements can be made. It is indeed still good.
